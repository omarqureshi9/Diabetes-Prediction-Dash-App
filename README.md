# Diabetes Risk Prediction Dash Application
This project generates a machine learning model from diabetes dataset and integrates it into a user interface using a Dash application.

The Dash application uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict binary outcomes based on user input features. 

The app allows users to input various features and get predictions of whether the class is positive or negative.

## Dataset
This project used the following dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdelazizsami/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction

This dataset contains information on the signs and symptoms of newly diagnosed diabetic patients or those at risk of developing diabetes. The data was collected through direct questionnaires administered to patients at the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh
## Application Features

- Input fields for age and various binary features.
- Predict button to generate the prediction.
- Displays the prediction result (Positive/Negative).
